# React Task Manager

Live demo: [http://azriz.com/taskmanager/]

This is a demonstration of my ReactJS skills to produce an app where you can add tasks, edit them, mark them as completed/incomplete, and use the filter dropdown to only show the ones you choose.

The most common React hooks were employed in this project (useState, useEffect) as well as modern ES6 Javascript functionality such as array mapping and filtering etc, always preferring arrow functions.

The CSS was provided to me, it is not written by myself in this project as the focus was the React/JS work.

To see my own CSS work, please see my other projects (React Blog and Portfolio Site).
